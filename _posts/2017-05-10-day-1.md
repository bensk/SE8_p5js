Try dragging the **Aim**.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="700">
var aim = "Aim: How can we begin learning a new programming language?";
var do_now = "Do Now: How many programming languages have you learned? Which is your favorite, and why?"

function setup() {
	createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

}

function draw() {
	background('white');
	textSize(30);
	textFont("Proxima Nova");
	textStyle('bold');
	fill(`#FF4296`);
	if (mouseIsPressed) {
		text(aim, mouseX, mouseY, windowWidth);
		var do_now = "Uh oh...where'd the Do Now go?"
		textAlign('center')

	} else {
		text(aim, 10, 50, windowWidth);
		var do_now = "Do Now: How many programming languages have you learned? Which is your favorite, and why?"
	}
	textSize(18)
	textStyle('bold')
	fill('#424242')
	text(do_now, 10, 100, windowWidth, windowHeight)
}



function windowResized() {
	resizeCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
}
</script>

This is **<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>**. It allows you to create interactive "sketches" using HTML/CSS and JS, which you <mark>already know</mark>.

**<span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>** works on a `canvas`.

Everything you "draw" will be drawn on this canvas, `pixels` on a screen.

Here's one for you to play with:

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="200">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200,200);
}

function draw() {
  rect(50,50,80,50);
}

// What's this!?
</script>


## Exit Slip!

1. What happens if you change the numbers on line 6: `rect(50,50,80,50);`?
2. How could you draw a square?
3. How do you write a comment in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>?
