## Do Now
Create a sketch with an emoji bounces off the edges of the screen.
> Hint: How do we make `text` in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>? How did you make a shape "bounce" off the edge of the screen?

## Path around the edge
Very soon, we're going to build an interactive game in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>, which will require us to be **very** good at using conditionals.

One more practice project:
