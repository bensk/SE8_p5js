## Do Now (in p5)

Create this "traffic light" in p5:

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Code_Examples/TrafficLight" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:solid 1px"></iframe>

**Rubric**

|Specification   |Points   |
|---|:---:|
|3 ellipses, each light up different colors   |  3 |
| It must be able to "light" up in three different colors **one at a time**  |  1 |
|Only one light should be lit at a time   |  1 |
|  Lights are **conditionally** activated[^1] | 1  |
|**Total**|6|




[^1]: It's your choice how to activate the lights. Mine are based off `mouseY`. You could use a click, `mouseX`, your keyboard...whatever you want.
