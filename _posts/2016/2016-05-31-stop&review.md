## Do Now (in p5)

Create this "traffic light" in p5:

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Code_Examples/TrafficLight" width="100%" height="400px" style="border:solid 1px"></iframe>

It must be able to "light" up in three different colors **one at a time**.

Only one light should be lit at a time.
It's your choice how to activate the lights. Mine are based off `mouseY`.

You could use a click, `mouseX`, your keyboard...whatever you want.
