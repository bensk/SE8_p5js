## Ruh roh broken code <small>(Thanks, Aileen!)</small>

<p class="lead">Read the error messages. Try to fix the bugs, and include a comment for what you changed, and <mark>why</mark>.</p>

<code>Hint: Try reading reading the error messages. They'll point you to a specific line number. Look one line up or down, seeing if you spot anything off. </code>


<p class="lead">If you finish that, go read my comments on your Quiz_App and resume working.</p>
