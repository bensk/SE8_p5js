In this assignment, you're going to create an app to calculate your GPA. The code will look something like this:

```python
# variable = input("question?")
math = input("What's your grade in math?")
# What happens if you try this?
```

- [ ] How many inputs do you need?
- [ ] What kind of data do you get back from an input?

_Try this to find out a type of data:_

```python
  print type(input("What's your grade in math?"))
```
