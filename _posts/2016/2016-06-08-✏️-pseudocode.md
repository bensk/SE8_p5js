## Do Now
Write down instructions to walk around the edge of the room.

## Pseudocode
Writing out simplified instructions that can be turned into code.

Remember the 🍞 PB&J?

Write out pseudocode for the four conditionals needed to make a path around the screen. Pretend you're talking to the emoji:

> "Go to the right until you hit the edge of the screen"

etc...

Now, we're going to see if we can be more specific in our pseudocode, by starting to add variables.

In your code, you will have some variables for the `x` and `y` position of the emoji. You also have the built-in variables of `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` to know where the edges of the screen are.

Underneath you pseudocode, write yourself a comment for how to start doing this in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>
