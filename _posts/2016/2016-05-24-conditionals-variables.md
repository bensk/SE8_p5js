## Do Now (in <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>)

1. Create a canvas that is the size of the screen
2. Create a shape (`ellipse()`, `rect()`, etc) that follows your mouse
3. Write a conditional so that the `fill()` of the shape changes if the mouse is on the **left** or **right** side of the screen.

Like this:

## Conditionals & Variables

Our next challenge is to make a sketch where a ~~ball~~ shape bounces around the screen. 

| Specification     | Points     |
| :------------- | :-------------: |
| Your `canvas` must resize to the window.            | 1|
|Draw with either a shape (`rect()`, `ellipse()`, etc.) or a `line()` _in ðŸŒˆmultiple colorsðŸŒˆ_.|   1|
|Must be able to start **and** stop drawing ("pen up" and "pen down")|1|
|**Total:**| __ / 3|
