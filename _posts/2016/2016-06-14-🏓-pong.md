## Learning Target
I can write the pseudcode for pong

## Do Now
In <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>, make a rectangle that follows your mouse.

Like this:

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Code_Examples/Paddle/index.html" style="border:solid 1px; border-color: #ED1F5E" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>

<p style = "font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: grey;">I think you can see where this is going...</p>

## üèì Pong
We're going to build a version of [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), one of the first computer games.

## Pseudocode
![pong]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pong.png)
‚ú± Pretend you're talking to the ball. How should it move?    
‚ú± What about the paddles. How should they move?

## Pseudocode with variables
‚ú± Redo your pseudocode, using x, y, windowWidth, and windowHeight.    
‚ú± How did writing pseudocode change how your wrote p5 code?
