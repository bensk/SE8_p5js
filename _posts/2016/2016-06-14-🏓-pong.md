## Do Now
In <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span>, make a rectangle that follows your mouse.

Like this:

<iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/Code_Examples/Paddle/index.html" style="border:solid 1px; border-color: #ED1F5E" width="100%" height="200px"></iframe>

<p style = "font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; color: grey;">I think you can see where this is going...</p>

## 🏓 Pong
We're going to build a version of [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), one of the first computer games.

## Pseudocode
![pong]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pong.png)
✱ Pretend you're talking to the ball. How should it move?    
✱ What about the paddles. How should they move?

## Pseudocode with variables
✱ Redo your pseudocode, using `x`, `y`, `windowWidth`, and `windowHeight`.    
✱ How did writing pseudocode change how your wrote p5 code?

| I can write the pseudcode for pong.                                                               |
| I can use built-in variables to make a paddle follow my mouse.                                    |
| I can write <span style="color: #ED1F5E">p5</span> comments to explain my iteration and thinking. |

_Next time..._
