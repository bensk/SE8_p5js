## Do Now

Check this out:

<iframe src = "{{ site.baseurl}}/Code_Examples/MakeStuffMove/index.html" width ="100%" height="200px" style="border:none"></iframe>

Look at the code:

```javascript
function setup() {
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)
    x = windowWidth / 2
    y = windowHeight / 2
}

function draw() {
    background('white')
    ellipse(x, y, 50, 50)

    x = x + 10
    if (x>windowWidth){
        x = 0
    }
}
```

1. Observe and describe the motion of the ellipse.
2. Which line do you think makes the ellipse move? Why?
3. Which line(s) do you think makes the ellipse start on the left side of the screen? Why?
